## Know_Your_Mentee
- Hey , this is **Prakhar Singh**(1st year Btech graduate) from *Electrical & Electronics Engineering* branch of [National Institute of Technology , Tiruchhirrapalli](https://www.nitt.edu).
- I belong to Agra (Uttar Pradesh).
- I passed my class 12th from **Kendriya Vidyalaya No.2 , Agra Cantt** , and class 10th from **St. Pauls Church College** in the year 2016 and 2014 respectively.
  - 12th % **93.4**
  - 10th % **92.6**
- I believe that with *hardwork* and *perseverence* anything can be achieved. Being knowledgeable is necessary , but even if you're not  being **passionate enough** for something , will make you learn it.
- If any responsibility is *bestowed* apon me , I'll surely put it above my **sleep** in my priority list , if needed to do so.
